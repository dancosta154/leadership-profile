                <ul class="about-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Location:</strong> I grew up in Framingham, MA and now live in Scarborough, ME
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Personal Life:</strong> Girlfriend (Alexus) and dog (Lucas – he's an Irish Setter)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Education:</strong> Went to Arizona State University (Criminal Justice)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Career:</strong> I focus on aligning people, process, and priorities to solve meaningful problems. I’ve led teams, rebuilt workflows, and created structure that turns chaos into coordination. I’m drawn to work where the impact is real and measurable
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What I do for Fun:</strong> Friends, Travel, Hiking, Fly Fishing, Camping
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>One Passion at Work:</strong> I love simplifying complexity — breaking down tough problems so they're solvable at the root, not just patched at the surface
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What People May Misunderstand About Me:</strong> I may come across as serious in the moment, but I'm always open and approachable
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How I like to Communicate:</strong> Slack, Zoom, Email as last resort!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I'm no stranger to moving. I've lived in eight different states, returned to Colorado and Maine three separate times, and lived in California twice. There was even a nine-year period when I never stayed in one location for more than nine months!
